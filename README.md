Zepto Data Analysis 
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes sales and product data from Zepto, focusing on pricing, discounts, stock availability, and customer behavior. 
Using SQL, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and generate useful business insights.

The dataset contains product details such as:

Product Name

MRP (Maximum Retail Price)

Discounted Selling Price

Discount Percent

Stock Availability

Weight

🔍 Analysis Performed

Some of the key questions solved in this project:

• Calculate total stock per category.
• Compute potential revenue if all stock is sold at discounted price.
• Find products where discounted price > 90% of MRP (low discount).
• Identify products weighing less than 100 grams but having high selling prices.
• Compare high discount percent products with below-average MRP.
• Top 5 most expensive products by MRP.

📈 Insights:

• Lightweight products (<100g) sometimes have premium pricing.
• Potential revenue estimation helps evaluate stock valuation.
• Discount strategies vary significantly across categories
